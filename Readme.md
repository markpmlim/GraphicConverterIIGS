A simple Playground demonstration on how to 

a) load an Apple IIGS graphic file with a file type and auxiliary type of $C1 and $0000,

b) extract data from the loaded file and use the information to instantiate a raw bitmap which can be used by macOS to create a CGImage object,

c) create an instance of NSImage from the CGImage object, and,

d) display the NSImage object in a Playground view.
